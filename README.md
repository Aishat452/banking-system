# Coming Soon: My INTERNSHIP PROGRAM AT "The Sparks Foundation" 

## Dynamic Banking Website

This is a simple dynamic website that allows users(bank sustem admins) to transfer money between multiple customers. The website is designed to handle up to 10 customers and record all transfer transactions in a database. There is no login page or user creation functionality included in this website.

### The Features

Home Page: The landing page of the website.
View all Customers: Displays a list of all the customers in the database.
Select and View one Customer: Allows users to view the details of a specific customer.
Transfer Money: Enables users to transfer money from one customer to another.
Select customer to transfer to: Provides a list of customers to choose from for transferring money.
View all Customers: Displays the updated list of all customers after a transfer transaction.
Database

The website requires a database to store customer information and transfer records. You can choose from various database options such as MySQL, MongoDB, or Postgres. For this project, you need to create a database with a table named "Customers" and a table named "Transfers".

The "Customers" table will include the following fields:

Name: The name of the customer.
Email: The email address of the customer.
Current Balance: The current balance of the customer.
The "Transfers" table should record all transfer transactions and include the following fields:

Sender: The customer who sent the money.
Receiver: The customer who received the money.
Amount: The amount of money transferred.
Timestamp: The timestamp of the transfer.
Making sure I populate the "Customers" table with dummy data for up to 10 customers.

### Hosting
