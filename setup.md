# Creating a Simple Dynamic Website

To create a dynamic website with the specified features, follow these steps:

## 1. Project Setup
- Create a new directory for your project.
- Inside the project directory, create the following files and folders:
  - `index.html`: Home page HTML file.
  - `customers.html`: View all customers HTML file.
  - `single-customer.html`: View one customer HTML file.
  - `transfer.html`: Transfer money HTML file.
  - `style.css`: CSS file for styling.
  - `script.js`: JavaScript file for client-side scripting.
  - `server.js`: Server-side JavaScript file.
  - `package.json`: Node.js project configuration file.

## 2. Design HTML Pages
- Open `index.html` and create a simple homepage with a link to view all customers.
- Open `customers.html` and design a table to display the customer details fetched from the database.
- Open `single-customer.html` and display the details of a selected customer.
- Open `transfer.html` and create a form to transfer money between customers.

## 3. Style Your Pages
- Open `style.css` and add CSS rules to style your HTML pages as desired.

## 4. Implement Client-Side Scripting
- Open `script.js` and write JavaScript code to handle client-side interactions, such as making AJAX requests to the server.

## 5. Set Up the Server
- Open `server.js` and install the necessary dependencies, such as Express.js and your chosen database driver.
- Set up a server using Express.js, define the required routes, and handle database interactions.

## 6. Connect to the Database
- Install the necessary database driver for your chosen database system (e.g., mysql, mongoose for MongoDB).
- Connect to the database from `server.js` and implement functions to fetch and update customer and transfer data.

## 7. Generate Dummy Data
- Write a script in `server.js` to populate the database with dummy data for up to 10 customers.

## 8. Test and Debug
- Start the server and open the website locally to test if everything is functioning as expected.

## 9. Choose a Hosting Provider
- Sign up for a hosting provider that supports your chosen technology stack (e.g., Heroku, 000webhost).
- Follow their instructions to deploy your application.

## 10. Version Control and Deployment
- Create a repository on GitLab or another version control platform to host your code.
- Commit your code to the repository and push it.

Please note that this is a high-level overview, and there are many details involved in each step. You may need to refer to specific documentation for the technologies you choose and adapt the code to your needs. If you have any specific questions or need further guidance on a particular step, feel free to ask.
